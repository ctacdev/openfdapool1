# FDA PharmaQuery #

Our <a href="https://openfda.ctacdev.com" target="_blank">working prototype</a>.

## Description ##

Our first step in building an effective application was identifying the proper User Centered Design approaches.  We involved potential users in as many steps as possible from the brainstorming phase to the prototype.  

A Product Owner (PO) is the lean agile leader of the multidisciplinary team that produced this prototype. The PO represents our customer and industry surrogate, <em><strong>the accountable team leader with the vision of the solution and the ability to ensure a timely release of a quality deliverable.</strong></em> The PO led a <em><strong>self-organizing agile team empowered</strong></em> to define the product’s requirements, create and test the usability of the proposed design, develop and test the application, and create and run test cases to validate the solution against the requirements.

Working in a time boxed and <em><strong>iterative cycle</strong></em>, we sought input from all stakeholders and built the application using a test driven development (TDD) technique. This produced a high quality-working slice of the application that was subjected to usability testing and feedback. The results were fed back into the iterative process for further refinement.

User-Centered Design (UCD) is the process of focusing on the end-users’ perceptions and habits to map the web application experience, in place of the vision of a single creative source. This allowed the end user to steer all aspects of the development process – not just the interface or technologies. Our agile team used a process of <em><strong>participatory design alongside six specific types of UCD techniques (Personas, User Interviews, Workflow Determination, User Testing, Prototyping, and Accessibility Testing).</strong></em>  

We created user profiles by researching demographics, and posed a character based on those findings.  We gave them relatable biographies and a humanized situation to comprehend their potential interaction with the app. Personas determined our interviewees: pharmacists, patients in pharmacy lines, journalists, and doctors.

We started with broad questions like “What do you expect from this application [that can query a drug database]?” These answers helped us understand the motives of potential users. The PharmaQuery interviews gave specific insight for the need to determine maximum non-toxic dosage of drug ingredients across a combination of prescription drugs. We then mapped our findings with flowcharts that demonstrate the direct way to achieve the user end-goal.  

<em><strong>Testing</strong></em> was done with simple wireframe drawings to confirm that the workflows were correct. With the PharmaQuery testing, we quickly determined that our users primary interest in the FDA API was the potential ingredient overlaps between commonly prescribed drugs that could create a toxic combination.  Tangential ideas were then relegated to a prioritized backlog.  We tested usability, and refined the functionality through interactive wireframes that allowed the user to provide instant feedback on potential workflow inefficiencies.

While the comp was based on the final wireframe, the aesthetic details of the application in UCD were not allowed to detract from the product’s mission, which should be instantly recognized while the visual appeal comes second.  Subsequently, <em><strong>the developer received a style guide for the initial development.</strong></em>  We tested to ensure that color contrasts, text size, and tabbing orders allowed access to users with color, visual or other impairments. We included a tailored checklist for consultation during development.

To increase efficiency, we relied on standard design patterns that users are familiar with in modern web based applications and the responsive web design to improve accessibility across a variety of common mobile Internet devices.

Our developers relied exclusively on open source and free technologies: the front end framework was built with <em><strong>Bootstrap, the SASS preprocessor ensured streamlined styling, the Rails application framework built on Ruby provided the architecture, and this front-end code was developed using the Brackets editor</strong></em> to reduce development costs while improving the quality and security posture of PharmaQuery.

We did an <em><strong>iteration of user testing with the application on multiple devices.</strong></em> After presenting the prototype in a casual user feedback session that involved user walkthroughs, we realized that the “Interaction Widget’ application workflow needed rethinking. The preliminary wireframes on the wireframing software Axure did not indicate the size of the infographic, which presented issue with locating the interactive search input. To balance the interest-garnering infographic with the search, we minimized the amount of space it used on the page and moved the search near to the results.  The final portion of the quality check process tested the integrity of the customer-supplied documentation by installing and running the application solely using the <em><strong>installation documentation and instructions</strong></em> provided to ensure that the customer is provisioned a <em><strong>dependency free deliverable that can be deployed into a fresh environment.</strong></em>

a. Assigned one leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted:  <em><strong>As part of our agile process, CTAC assigned a prototype project leader with the authority and responsibility for the development of the 18F Agile prototype, including accountability for the timely release and quality of the product.</strong></em>

b. Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum three of the labor categories limited to the Design Pool Labor categories to design the prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services:  <em><strong>CTAC’s prototype project leader, with assistance from our Project Management Office, assembled a multidisciplinary team and with the skills required in the solicitation.  As a first step in the prototype project planning, we analyzed project requirements and develop a staffing plan, and then populated the team staff having the appropriate skill mix.  Our staffing is based on our 22+ years of experience supporting similar projects for our Government and private sector clients. For the design effort, we used the following labor categories: Product Manager (10 hrs), Visual designer (16 hrs), Front-end developers/ designers (32 hrs), and Researcher/usability tester (16 hrs) (See Attachment C - Price Quote Sheet (submitted through eBuy).</strong></em>

c. Understand what people need, by including people (see note #1) in the prototype design process: <em><strong>Users were interviewed using a questionnaire as well as through user testing.</strong></em>

d. Used at least three “human-centered design” techniques or tools:  <em><strong>We used personas for determining user demographic, interviews with targeted users matching personas, iterative user-testing with hand-drawn wireframes and later with low-fidelity wireframes on paper.</strong></em>

e. Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library:  <em><strong>We developed a style guide for the developers to use.</strong></em>

f. Used at least three modern (see Note#2) and open source front end or client side (see note #3) web technologies:  <em><strong>For this project, we used Bootstrap, Sass, jQuery, jQuery UI, D3.js, HandleBars.js, Brackets text editor.</strong></em>

g. Performed usability tests with people:  <em><strong>Our usability testing was achieved through interviews, user-testing with wireframes, and user testing with the prototype.</strong></em>

h. Used an interactive approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype: <em><strong>Our interactive approach was achieved through interviews, user-testing with wireframes, and user testing with the prototype. At each step information was fed back to the designers to make appropriate adjustments in the design.</strong></em>

i. Created a prototype that works on multiple devices and presents a responsive design: <em><strong>We did an iteration of user testing of the application on multiple devices</strong></em>.

j. Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine:  <em><strong>The final portion of the quality check process we used tested the integrity of the application by installing and running it solely using the installation documentation and instructions provided to ensure that the customer is provisioned a dependency free deliverable that can be deployed into a fresh environment. </strong></em>
